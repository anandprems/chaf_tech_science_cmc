1. MITBIH_PTB_dataset_CNN_Selection_of_layers file which is helpful for us to select the best layers with accuracy, so we need to try for PTB dataset and as well as for MITBIH dataset, AF- ReLU

2. MITBIH_PTB_dataset_CNN_different _AF file which explains about the importande of different AFs for PTB and MITBIH dataset, which helpful for selecting top AFs for the final proposed CHAF

3. MITBIH_PTB_dataset_CNN_6_layer_af_fusion file which is used for CHAF concept - differnt combinations - heterogeneous AF at each layer - finalizing best combinations

4. dataset.txt - downloading datatset from drive
